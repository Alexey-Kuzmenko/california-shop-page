### Email verification API

In this project, I use email verification API. When you write your email on input and click the `'Sign-up'` button, the program sends a request to **EVA API**. After that program takes a response from API with data about user email. <a href='https://eva.pingutil.com/'>**EVA API website**</a>

Input with user email:
